# Feedreader Testing Project

Feed Reader Testing is a project included in Udacityâ€™s Front End Nanodegree program. In this project, students learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These tests are used to check the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
